            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In the circumstances of the A4 How To Make (Almost) Anything class, <br>
                I had to design and print a 3D object, either a pen or a whistle, I chose to make a pen with a RPG D20 on top</p>

                <h3>Learn Blender</h3>
                <p>Due to some frustration about the licences of SOLIDWORKS last year,<br>
                    I decided to pickup an open source 3D software: blender<br>
                    so the prerequisite is to learn some blender aka 1h20 of blender guru tutorials</p>

                <h3>Measuring</h3>
                <p>The 1st step is to measure the dimensions of the standard bic pen using a ruler:<br>
                    - the base of the ink container is 4mm wide<br>
                    - the base of the point is 5 mm wide<br>
                    - the pen itself is 8mm wide and 13.5mm high</p>

                <img src="images/3Dpen3.png" alt="measuring" class="project-image">
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Modelling</h3>
                <p>started by putting toggether a cylinder and a geode to make up the basic idea,<br> 
                    making sure to adjust for the measurements, I want the pen to be 17cm high</p>
                <img src="images/3Dpen4.png" alt="basic" class="project-image">
                <p>after some struggling, add a pen hole by extruding the volume (4mm wide)</p>
                <img src="images/3Dpen5.png" alt="extrude" class="project-image">
                <p>added the 20 on top of the dice using the text object and clipping it on the surface of the dice using the magnet tool</p>
                <img src="images/3Dpen6.png" alt="text" class="project-image">
                <p>and a bevel to make the tip of the pen, leaving the very end of the tip 1mm thick</p>
                <img src="images/3Dpen7.png" alt="bevel" class="project-image">
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Print time</h3>
                <p>using orcaslicer, we cut the pen in half for printing, <br>
                    otherwise supports could be printed inside the pen wich isn't ideal</p>
                <img src="images/3Dpen12.png" alt="slice" class="project-image">
                
                <p>Then let the printer do it's magic</p>
                <img src="images/3Dpen8.png" alt="printing" class="project-image">
                <p>When the print is done, remove the supports to get the full piece<br></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Assembling and sanding</h3>
                <p>Since the penpoint couldn't fit in the printed pen as is,<br>
                    some sanding was necessary using sandpaper</p>
                <img src="images/3Dpen11.png" alt="sandtip" class="project-image">
                <p>stick the two parts together, sand the contour and voila. The pen is done :D</p>
